			<h2 className="mb-2 text-lg font-semibold text-black">How to claim work-terms towards your P.Eng</h2>
			<p className="mb-4 text-black">On behalf of PEGNL, Mark Fewer held an information session on March 15, 2017, to talk about claiming undergraduate work experience towards your Professional License.</p>

			<ul className="mb-4 list-inside list-disc text-black">
				<li>Keep a PEGNL Logbook during your work-terms with bi-weekly entries (or at least monthly) between 8-10 lines each, and have a P.Eng (or equivalent) sign off on each entry.</li>
				<li>You can claim up to 3 work-terms (a maximum of 12 months) of undergraduate work experience, starting after you complete academic Term 4 in the program. This means you can back-log the fall 2016 work-term, and have a P.Eng (or equivalent) that you worked with sign off on the entries, but it is unnecessary since we still have 3 work terms left.</li>
				<li>If the person signing off on your entries is not a P.Eng, PEGNL will determine equivalency by having them submit their resume with your logbook, so make sure you supervisor is aware of this expectation.</li>
				<li>Blank logbook pages, and example entries can be found on the PEGNL website. You can print the pages yourself or buy an actual logbook from the PEGNL office downtown. If you do not use their logbook, it is recommended that you at least follow their format.</li>
				<li>Not looking to stay in NL for your entire career? Don't worry, your professional license is easily transferable between Canadian provinces.</li>
				<li>The quality and type of experience you earn is also assessed, so be aware of PEGNL's definition of acceptable work experience.</li>
			</ul>
